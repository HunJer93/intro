		Here is a little information about me: <br>
		<br>I am a computer programming major at Trident Technical College. I returned to school to make a 
		career change from a full-time musician. As a musician, I played and taught drums, bass,
		guitar, and (just a little bit) of piano. Besides music, some of my other hobbies are cooking, playing
		video games, and jogging. I love creating and building things, which is probably why I was drawn to
		programming! <br>

		<br>I am also lucky enough to have a lovely fiance who I am excited to marry this December 2021! Due to COVID, 
		we both made the decision to switch careers into the tech industry, and she started her new job as
		a technical writter right when I started my spring semester this year! As scary as making career changes
		can be, it is nice to have someone else to go through it together.
